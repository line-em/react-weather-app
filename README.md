# React Weather App

I just build a React Weather App! ðŸŽ‰
I learned a lot about useState(), hooks, and useEffect() while doing this project.
There's still areas in which I could improve, but all in all, I feel really excited to have done this project.ðŸ˜Š

As for functionality, this app shows the current weather, according to the typed location, and the 3-day forecast.
You can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius, and the app will automatically update the temperature units.
The app will update the background image based on the weather.
As for visuals, I wanted to simulate a retro and stylized app window in CSS.
